# Welcome to Campground Reservations
Online reservation system prototype for campground reservations leveraging Django, Python, JS and React, to help automate a campground's offline campsite reservation process.

Integrates two API's: Google Maps for campsite locations and historical weather information for projected temperature averages over pending reservation dates.

## Features
* Browse campsites by date availability and amenities
* Sort campsites based on physical location on map
* Evaluate individual campsite amenities
* Create reservations for a given campsite, making it unavailable for future searches

> Styled to match and integrate with [pre-existing campground](https://www.otterlakepark.net/) website for seamless transition for users.
